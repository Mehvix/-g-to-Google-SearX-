### What:

Easily swap between search engines with the press of a button while maintaining your current query. Similar to [DuckDuckGo bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bang) except with a keypress.

### Installation:

1. Install a userscript extension, such as [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/).
2. Install the script [here](https://github.com/Mehvix/search-engine-redirect/raw/master/SearchEngineRedirect.user.js).

### Usage:

Press a search engine's respective key to change to that engine. For example, if you are on DuckDuckGo and wanted to change to Brave, you would hit `b`. If you were on Brave and wanted to go to Google, you would hit `g`.

|   Engine   | Key |
| :--------: | :-: |
|   Google   | `g` |
|   SearX    | `x` |
| Startpage  | `s` |
| DuckDuckGo | `d` |
|   Brave    | `b` |
